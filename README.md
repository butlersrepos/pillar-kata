===========
Task: Make a babysitter fee calculator.

Language chosen: Javascript.

Inputs: Start time, End time, Bed Time.

Outputs: Total fee based on rules of kata established here - https://gist.github.com/jameskbride/5482722

Assumptions: Since there's no product owner in this scenario I will be assuming that bedtimes are always before midnight and that fractional hours don't come into the equation at all.
